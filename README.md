In this application we will be understanding how to add routing in the application:

Routing is a way of moving from one component to another component, it makes sure tht your application is a single page application. In this cse if you are browser router than your page will never be reloaded and still you will be able to move from one component to another

React-Router is the master library to achieve routing in react.
This contains two small libraries:
react-router-dom:this is for web app
react-router-native:this is for mobile application

when you are starting with routing in your application, you have to make sure that your complete application is wrapped with the **Browser Router**.

When you are defining routes or all the paths then you have to make sure that all of them are wrapped with **Routes**.

Then to define any Route we will be using **Route**
